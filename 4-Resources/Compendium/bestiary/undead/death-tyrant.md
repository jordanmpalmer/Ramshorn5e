    \ saving throw or be [paralyzed](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\

    \ save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't\
    \ take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn,\
    \ not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 5. Enervation Ray.\
    \ The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking dice:\
    \ 8d8|avg (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on\
    \ a successful one.  \n- 6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature,\
    \ it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it\
    \ up to 30 feet in any direction. It is [restrained](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\

    \ worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The death tyrant\
    \ can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a\
    \ simple tool or opening a door or a container.  \n- 7. Sleep Ray. The targeted\
    \ creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain\
    \ [unconscious](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1\
    \ minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action\
    \ to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n- 8. Petrification\
    \ Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a\
    \ failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained).\
    \ It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the\
    \ effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ until freed by the  [greater restoration](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.  \n- 9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature,\
    \ it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take dice: 10d8|avg (10d8)\
    \ force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body\
    \ becomes a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller\
    \ nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without\
    \ a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical\
    \ force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- 10. Death Ray.\
    \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take\
    \ dice: 10d10|avg (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces\

# [Death Tyrant](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/undead/death-tyrant.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 29*  

On rare occasions, a beholder's sleeping mind drifts to places beyond its normal madness, imagining a reality in which it exists beyond death. When such dreams take hold, a beholder can transform, its flesh sloughing away to leave a death tyrant behind. This monster possesses the cunning and much of the magic it had in life, but it is fueled by the power of undeath. A death tyrant appears as a massive, naked skull, with a pinpoint of red light gleaming in its hollow eye socket. With its eyestalks rotted away, ten spectral eyes hover above the creature and glare in all directions.

## Deathly Despot

As they did when they were beholders, death tyrants lord their power over other creatures. Moreover, a beholder's ability to quash magical energy with its central eye gives way to a more sinister power in a death tyrant, which can transform former slaves and enemies into undead servants.

Zombies created by a death tyrant are used and discarded as needed. They stand guard at the entrances to the death tyrant's lair or guard its treasure vaults.

Acting as bait for traps or as combat fodder, zombies keep powerful enemies distracted while the death tyrant moves into position and prepares to destroy them.

## Armies of the Dead

A death tyrant that embraces undeath becomes an engine of destruction. Driven by a hunger for power and security, it advances against humanoid settlements, using its eye rays to destroy every creature it encounters, then building an army of undead. If left unchecked, a death tyrant might wipe out the population of a city in weeks, then set its undead eye on wider conquest. As each settlement falls, the death tyrant's zombie forces build to overwhelming numbers.

## Undead Nature

A death tyrant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

> A cluster of tiny lights descended from a dark crevice in the ceiling. These motes cast an eerie glow on the great, alien skull that hung beneath them.

## A Death Tyrant's Lair

A death tyrant's lair is usually the same site it held as a beholder, but it contains more trappings of death and decay. A death tyrant encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 15 (13,000 XP).

The death tyrant can't repeat an effect until all three have been used, and it can't use the same effect on consecutive rounds.
