# [Xorn](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/elemental/xorn.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 304. Available in the SRD.*  

Bizarre creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth, xorn sniff out gemstones and precious metals, then tunnel through earth and rock to consume those treasures. On the Material Plane, xorn must range far and wide through the Underdark to sustain themselves, becoming aggressive toward miners and treasure hunters when the valuable minerals of their diet are scarce.

A xorn's unnatural origins are suggested by its unusually heavy body and the large, powerful mouth sitting atop its head. Its three long arms are each tipped with sharp talons, and its three large, stone-lidded eyes see in all directions.

## Elemental Travelers

Possessed of the power of elemental earth, a xorn glides through stone and dirt as easily as a fish swims through water. It doesn't displace earth or stone when it moves, but merges with and flows through it, leaving no tunnel, hole, or hint of its passage.
