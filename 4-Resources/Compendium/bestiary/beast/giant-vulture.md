# [Giant Vulture](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-vulture.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 329. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A giant vulture has advanced intelligence and a malevolent bent. Unlike its smaller kin, it will attack a wounded creature to hasten its end. Giant vultures have been known to haunt a thirsty, starving creature for days to enjoy its suffering.
