# [Giant Lizard](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 326. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A giant lizard can be ridden or used as a draft animal. Lizardfolk also keep them as pets, and subterranean giant lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and other Underdark dwellers.
