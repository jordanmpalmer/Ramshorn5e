# [Blink Dog](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 318, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A blink dog takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for displacer beasts and attack them on sight.
