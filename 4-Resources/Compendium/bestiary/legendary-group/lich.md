# Lich

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The lich rolls a `dice: d8|avg` (`d8`) and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.  
- The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich's lair.  
- The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 15d6|avg` (`15d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.
