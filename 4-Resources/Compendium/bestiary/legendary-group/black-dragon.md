# Black Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked [prone](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) piercing damage.  
- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with [darkvision](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/senses.md#darkvision) can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.  

### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) or [ancient](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md)) black dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Filth Burst.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is "difficult terrain".  
- **Grasping Muck.** Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon's lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon's choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Noxious Gas.** A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.  
- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.  
- Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.  

If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) days.

### Additional Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a black dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Ennui.** Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair are filled with listless despair.  
- **Grating Spies.** Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks. The dragon can suppress this effect at will.  
- **Rotting Domain.** Stinging bugs are aggressive and the air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.
