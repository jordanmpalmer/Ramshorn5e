# Kraken

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the kraken takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:

- A strong current moves through the kraken's lair. Each creature within 60 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from the kraken. On a success, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from the kraken.  
- Creatures in the water within 60 feet of the kraken have vulnerability to lightning damage until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- The water in the kraken's lair becomes electrically charged. All creatures within 120 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region containing a kraken's lair is warped by the creature's blasphemous presence, creating the following magical effects:

- The kraken can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the [control weather](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/control-weather.md) spell.  
- Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These elementals can't leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 (-5).  
- Aquatic creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are [charmed](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the kraken and aggressive toward intruders in the area.  

When the kraken dies, all of these regional effects fade immediately.
