# Aboleth

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- The aboleth casts [phantasmal force](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/phantasmal-force.md) (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining [concentration](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on this effect, the aboleth can't take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth's phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.  
- Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked [prone](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone). The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.  
- Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.  
- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.  
- As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature [charmed](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains [concentration](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#concentration), as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.  

If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of `dice: 3d10|avg` (`3d10`) days.
