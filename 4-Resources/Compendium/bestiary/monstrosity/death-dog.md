# [Death Dog](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/death-dog.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 321. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, deserts, and the Underdark. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.
