# Charm of Restoration

This charm has 6 charges. You can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells: [greater restoration](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) (4 charges) or [lesser restoration](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) (2 charges). Once all its charges have been expended, the charm vanishes from you.
