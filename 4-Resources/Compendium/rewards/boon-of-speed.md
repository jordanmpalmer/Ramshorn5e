# Boon of Speed

Your walking speed increases by 30 feet. In addition, you can use a bonus action to take the [Dash](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) or [Disengage](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.
