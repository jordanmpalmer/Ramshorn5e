# Pole of Collapsing
*Wondrous Item, minor, common*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/pole-of-collapsing.webp#right)  


While holding this 10-foot pole, you can use an action to speak a command word and cause it to collapse into a 1-foot-long rod, for ease of storage. The pole's weight doesn't change. You can use an action to speak a different command word and cause the rod to revert to a pole; however, the rod will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.
