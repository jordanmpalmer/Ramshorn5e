# Baba Yaga's Pestle
*Melee Weapon, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
