# Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/helm-of-telepathy.webp#right)  


While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [detect thoughts](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain [concentration](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [detect thoughts](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md), you can use an action to cast the [suggestion](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
