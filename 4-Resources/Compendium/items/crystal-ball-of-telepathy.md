# Crystal Ball of Telepathy
*Wondrous Item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This [crystal ball](4-Resources/Compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [scrying](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell (save DC 17) with it.

While [scrying](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/scrying.md) with the [crystal ball](4-Resources/Compendium/items/crystal-ball.md), you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [suggestion](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [scrying](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/scrying.md) ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the [crystal ball](4-Resources/Compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) can't be used again until the next dawn.
