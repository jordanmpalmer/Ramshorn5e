# Potion of Cloud Giant Strength
*Potion, minor, very rare*  


When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 27 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a [cloud giant](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md).
