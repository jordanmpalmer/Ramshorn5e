# Boots of Elvenkind
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/boots-of-elvenkind.webp#right)  


While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks that rely on moving silently.
