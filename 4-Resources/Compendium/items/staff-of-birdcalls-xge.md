# Staff of Birdcalls
*Staff, minor, common*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This wooden staff is decorated with bird carvings. It has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds out to a range of 60 feet: a finch's chirp, a raven's caw, a duck's quack, a chicken's cluck, a goose's honk, a loon's call, a turkey's gobble, a seagull's cry, an owl's hoot, or an eagle's shriek.

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.
