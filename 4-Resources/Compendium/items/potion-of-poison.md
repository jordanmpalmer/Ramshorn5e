# Potion of Poison
*Potion, minor, uncommon, poison*  


This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [potion of healing](4-Resources/Compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An [identify](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/identify.md) spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). At the start of each of your turns while you are [poisoned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, you take `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`). The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
