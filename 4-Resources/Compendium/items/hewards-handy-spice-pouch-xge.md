# Heward's Handy Spice Pouch
*Wondrous Item, minor, common*  


This belt pouch appears empty and has 10 charges. While holding the pouch, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges, speak the name of any nonmagical food seasoning (such as salt, pepper, saffron, or cilantro), and remove a pinch of the desired seasoning from the pouch. A pinch is enough to season a single meal. The pouch regains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn.
