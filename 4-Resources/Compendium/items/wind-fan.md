# Wind Fan
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/wind-fan.webp#right)  


While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the [gust of wind](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20% chance chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
