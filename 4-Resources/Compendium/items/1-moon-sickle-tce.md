# +1 Moon Sickle
*Melee Weapon, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Light](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moonlight. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your druid and ranger spells. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a `dice: d4|avg` (`d4`) and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle.
