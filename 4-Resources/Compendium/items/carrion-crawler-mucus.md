# Carrion Crawler Mucus
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 200 gp

This poison must be harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) [carrion crawler](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/carrion-crawler.md). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature is [paralyzed](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
