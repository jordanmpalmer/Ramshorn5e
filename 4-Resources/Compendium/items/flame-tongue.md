# Flame Tongue
*Generic Variant, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/flame-tongue.webp#right)  


You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
