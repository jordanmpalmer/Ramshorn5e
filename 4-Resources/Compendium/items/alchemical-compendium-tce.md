# Alchemical Compendium
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

Acrid odors cling to this stained, heavy volume. The book's metal fittings are copper, iron, lead, silver, and gold, some frozen mid-transition from one metal to another. When found, the book contains the following spells: [enlarge/reduce](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md), [feather fall](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/feather-fall.md), [flesh to stone](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/flesh-to-stone.md), [gaseous form](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md), [magic weapon](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/magic-weapon.md), and [polymorph](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/polymorph.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school.  
- As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original.
