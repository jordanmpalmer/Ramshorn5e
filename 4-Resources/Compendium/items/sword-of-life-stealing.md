# Sword of Life Stealing
*Generic Variant, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/sword-of-life-stealing.webp#right)  


When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 necrotic damage if it isn't a construct or an undead. You also gain 10 temporary hit points.

> [!note]
> According to the SRD, it is an extra `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) necrotic damage, although this is incorrect (https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/174522/53884).
