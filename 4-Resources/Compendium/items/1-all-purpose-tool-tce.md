# +1 All-Purpose Tool
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by an artificer)*  


This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the "Player's Handbook" for a list of [artisan's tools](4-Resources/Compendium/items/artisans-tools.md)). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.

While holding this tool, you gain a +1 bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
