# Gloves of Swimming and Climbing
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don't cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength ([Athletics](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks made to climb or swim.
