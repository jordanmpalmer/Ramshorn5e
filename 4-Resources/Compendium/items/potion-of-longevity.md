# Potion of Longevity
*Potion, minor, very rare*  


When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by `dice: 1d6 + 6|avg` (`1d6 + 6`) years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is a 10% chance cumulative chance that you instead age by `dice: 1d6 + 6|avg` (`1d6 + 6`) years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
