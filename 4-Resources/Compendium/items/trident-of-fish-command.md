This trident is a magic weapon. It has 3 charges. While you carry it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast [dominate beast](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/dominate-beast.md) (save DC 15) from it on a beast that has an innate swimming speed. The trident regains `dice: 1d3|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
