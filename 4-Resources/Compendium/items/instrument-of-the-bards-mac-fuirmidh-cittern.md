# Instrument of the Bards, Mac-Fuirmidh Cittern
*Instrument, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/instrument-of-the-bards-mac-fuirmidh-cittern.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/fly.md), [invisibility](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/levitate.md), and [protection from evil and good](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md).

In addition, the Mac-Fuirmidh cittern can be used to cast [barkskin](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/barkskin.md), [cure wounds](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md), and [fog cloud](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md).
