**Magic Themes**

| dice: d10 | Theme |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Book pages, origami, quills, and ink, all accompanied by rustling sounds and library scents |
| 2 | Brine-scented shapes of sharks, jellyfish, octopi, and other sea creatures |
| 3 | Food or utensils that carry the scent of cuisine from the spellcaster's homeland |
| 4 | Rich, copper scents accompanied by what appears to be the caster's own imbalanced humors |
| 5 | Bursts and strokes of watercolor painted by an invisible brush |
| 6 | Transparent weapons, armor, miniature war machines, and phantom soldiers |
| 7 | Golden rays that carry faint warmth and the hint of windblown sand |
| 8 | Rowdy barnyard animals accompanied by the warm scents of coops and stables |
| 9 | Manifestations of deep emotions, like the faint shackles of melancholy, sepia shades of nostalgia, or heart-shaped bursts of affection |
| 10 | Tiny whimsical or fearsome beings from the spellcaster's inescapable, recurring dreams |
