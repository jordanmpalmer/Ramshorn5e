**Guild Contact**

| dice: d6 | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **The Perfectionist**. Your contact is a skilled but obsessive creator consumed with the quest to create something perfect that will define their life's work and secure their legacy. They lose sight of right and wrong in pursuit of the finest materials and exciting opportunities. |
| 2 | **Attentive Overseer**. A guild representative takes personal interest in your group's tasks. They follow your exploits and know of your adventures before you return to report. Despite the unsettling depth of their knowledge, they seem genuinely eager to shepherd your work. |
| 3 | **Hidden Benefactor**. Whoever your contact is, they don't communicate directly. They send messages via couriers or letters. No one in the guild knows who the contact is, or if they do, they aren't telling you. Regardless, the contact's information is good, and they pay on time. |
| 4 | **Discerning Mentor**. No matter how well you perform, or how perfect your creations, nothing is ever good enough for this contact. They point out every flaw and missed opportunity. Are they bitter, lashing out at anyone around them, or do they recognize your potential and try to push you to greatness? |
| 5 | **Golem Guide**. Your guild contact is the soul of a long-dead artisan preserved in a construct body. This golem is wise and knowledgeable, but it has difficulty grasping the passage of time and the state of the world compared to its original era. |
| 6 | **Fallen Muse**. Your contact is a fallen celestial. Whether they regret their transgressions or hunger for vengeance, they provide divine inspiration and guidance to you and to the guild. Somehow your group and the guild inspire their hope for ascension. |
