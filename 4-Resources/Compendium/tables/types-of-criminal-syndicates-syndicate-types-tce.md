**Syndicate Types**

| dice: d6 | Syndicate |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Thieves' Guild**. A disparate convocation of thieves, spies, smugglers, and other scoundrels controls criminal activity in a region of a city. |
| 2 | **Assassin Society**. The network's livelihood is death. Members of the society hone their skills as cutthroats, poisoners, body-disposal specialists, and any other profession focused on ending lives. The society is motivated by profit or labors in service to a greater cause. |
| 3 | **Magical Arms Dealer**. The syndicate has cornered the market on deadly magical devices. They offer their services and wares for a price and acquire staggering magical might for those who meet their demands. |
| 4 | **Pirate Fleet**. This alliance of pirate captains is unified under a ruling captain or admiral and adheres to a strict code of honor. They converge only in response to an outside threat. |
| 5 | **Body Snatchers**. The syndicate consists predominantly, if not entirely, of creatures that possess or impersonate other people. They seek to replace influential individuals throughout society with members of their ranks. |
| 6 | **Thought Thieves**. These psychic criminals infiltrate their target's minds to steal secrets and disguise their existence. |
