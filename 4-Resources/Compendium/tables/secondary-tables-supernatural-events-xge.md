**Supernatural Events**

| dice: d100 | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 1-5 | You were ensorcelled by a fey and enslaved for `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) years before you escaped. |
| 6-10 | You saw a demon and ran away before it could do anything to you. |
| 11-15 | A devil tempted you. Make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your alignment shifts one step toward evil (if it's not evil already), and you start the game with an additional `dice: 1d20+50\|avg` (`1d20+50`) gp. |
| 16-20 | You woke up one morning miles from your home, with no idea how you got there. |
| 21-30 | You visited a holy site and felt the presence of the divine there. |
| 31-40 | You witnessed a falling red star, a face appearing in the frost, or some other bizarre happening. You are certain that it was an omen of some sort. |
| 41-50 | You escaped certain death and believe it was the intervention of a god that saved you. |
| 51-60 | You witnessed a minor miracle. |
| 61-70 | You explored an empty house and found it to be haunted. |
| 71-75 | You were briefly possessed. Roll a `dice: d6\|avg` (`d6`) to determine what kind of creature possessed you: 1, celestial; 2, devil; 3, demon; 4, fey; 5, elemental; 6, undead. |
| 76-80 | You saw a ghost. |
| 81-85 | You saw a ghoul feeding on a corpse. |
| 86-90 | A Celestial or Fiend visited you in your dreams to give a warning of dangers to come. |
| 91-95 | You briefly visited the Feywild or Shadowfell. |
| 96-100 | You saw a portal that you believe leads to another plane of existence. |
