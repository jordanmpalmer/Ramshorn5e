**Blessed Radiance Effects**

| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 01–06 | Golden light fills a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on one character in the region and then fades. That character and their friends in the cylinder gain the benefits of the [divine favor](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/divine-favor.md) spell for 1 hour. |
| 07–12 | Radiant energy erupts in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on one random creature in the region. Each creature in the sphere that isn't undead regains `dice: 3d6\|avg` (`3d6`) hit points. Each undead creature in the sphere takes `dice: 3d6\|avg` (`3d6`) radiant damage. |
| 13–18 | Aberrations, fiends, and undead in the region have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for the next 24 hours. |
| 19–24 | Each creature carrying the holy symbol of a deity from a non-evil plane while in the region gains advantage on saving throws for the next 24 hours. |
| 25–30 | One character in the region is suffused with celestial power. For 1 minute, the character's melee attacks deal an extra `dice: 2d6\|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage on a hit. |
| 31–36 | One simple or martial weapon that is nonmagical and carried by one character in the region gains the properties of a [mace of disruption](4-Resources/Compendium/items/mace-of-disruption.md) for 24 hours. |
| 37–42 | A flying, gleaming sword (use the [flying sword](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/construct/flying-sword.md) stat block in the "Monster Manual") appears within 60 feet of an aberration, a fiend, or an undead, which becomes the sword's target. The sword deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage and knows the exact location of its target while the target is within the region. The sword vanishes when it or its target is reduced to 0 hit points. |
| 43–48 | One character in the region hears whispers from celestial beings or refrains of celestial choirs. The character can ask those voices one question as if using the [commune](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/commune.md) spell. |
| 49–54 | Aberrations, fiends, and undead in the region give off a crimson glow for 1 minute. The creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, attacks against them have advantage if the attacker can see them, and the creatures can't benefit from being [invisible](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#invisible). |
| 55–60 | Celestial power explodes in a 30-foot-radius sphere of divine light centered on an aberration, a fiend, or an undead creature within the region. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes `dice: 4d6\|avg` (`4d6`) radiant damage and is [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded). On a success, it takes half damage and isn't [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded). |
| 61–66 | One character in the region feels a profound sense of purpose and gains the benefit of the [bless](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/bless.md) spell for 1 minute. They can choose two other creatures they can see to gain the spell's benefits as well. |
| 67–72 | A booming voice thunders in Celestial and can be heard throughout the region. Each creature in the region must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature gains `dice: 2d10\|avg` (`2d10`) temporary hit points. On a failure, the creature is [deafened](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#deafened) for 1 minute. |
| 73–78 | One character in the region gains the ability to cure afflictions for 1 hour. As an action, they can cast [lesser restoration](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) or [greater restoration](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) without expending a spell slot and requiring no material components. |
| 79–84 | The effects of a [hallow](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/hallow.md) spell (save DC 17), with one of its extra effects (DM's choice), settle over the region for 24 hours. |
| 85–90 | An angelic voice rings throughout the region. Each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or perform the grovel option of the [command](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/command.md) spell. |
| 91–95 | One character in the region permanently gains resistance to necrotic damage. Reroll if you've already rolled this effect. |
| 96–00 | One character in the region gains the ability to use the [Divine Intervention](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/cleric.md#Divine%20Intervention%20(Level%2010)) cleric feature, which succeeds automatically. The character can use the feature granted in this way only once and must use it within 7 days. Reroll if you've already rolled this effect. |
