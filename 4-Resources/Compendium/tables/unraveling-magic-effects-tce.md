**Unraveling Magic Effects**

| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 01–05 | All magic items in the region temporarily lose their magical properties, becoming nonmagical for 1 hour. Artifacts are unaffected. When the items regain their magic, a creature's attunement to any of them is restored. |
| 06–10 | The region becomes a dead-magic zone for 1 hour. For the duration, the entire region is affected by the [antimagic field](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/antimagic-field.md) spell. |
| 11–15 | One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed in [Otiluke's resilient sphere](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/otilukes-resilient-sphere.md) for 1 minute. |
| 16–20 | One random creature in the region that has expended spell slots regains one expended spell slot of a random level. |
| 21–25 | Flares of magical energy flash through the region for 1 minute. For the duration, each round on initiative count 20 (losing all ties) one random creature in the region takes `dice: 2d4\|avg` (`2d4`) damage of a type determined by a `dice: d6\|avg` (`d6`): 1, acid; 2, cold; 3, fire; 4, force; 5, lightning; or 6, thunder. |
| 26–30 | One of the characters in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into a [blink dog](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md), as if by the [polymorph](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/polymorph.md) spell. The spell lasts for 1 hour or until dispelled. |
| 31–35 | One random creature in the region that has spell slots expends one spell slot of a random level in a harmless shower of sparks and sounds. |
| 36–40 | All fire in the region freezes into ice that gives off a blue light equal to the illumination it normally provides. In addition, the region radiates "extreme cold" (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") for 1 day. |
| 41–45 | One random creature in the region with spell slots becomes a focal point for ambient magic for 1 hour. At the end of each of the creature's turns, other creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against the spellcaster's spell save DC or take `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) force damage. |
| 46–50 | The [flaming sphere](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/flaming-sphere.md) spell (save DC 15) spontaneously activates in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the party. On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), the sphere moves 30 feet toward the nearest creature. The sphere vanishes after 1 minute. |
| 51–55 | simple or martial weapons in the region that are nonmagical crackle with power. For 1 hour, they become magic weapons that grant a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with them. |
| 56–60 | Swirling energy surrounds one random creature in the region for 24 hours. For the duration, the creature gains resistance to force damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. |
| 61–65 | Each character in the region suddenly learns some magic. A character learns one wizard cantrip of the character's choice and knows the cantrip for `dice: 1d8\|avg` (`1d8`) days. |
| 66–70 | One random creature in the region crackles with sparks of light for 1 hour. For the duration, the creature magically sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, any creature it touches (requiring an unarmed strike if the target is unwilling) takes `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) force damage. |
| 71–75 | Lightning arcs in a 5-foot wide line between two creatures in the region that are within 30 feet of each other and not behind total cover. Each creature in the line (including the two) must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 4d6\|avg` (`4d6`) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 76–80 | The [reverse gravity](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/reverse-gravity.md) spell (save DC 18) activates for 1 minute, centered on the ground beneath one random creature in the region. |
| 81–85 | On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), two random creatures in the region must each make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save fails, the creatures magically teleport, switching places. If both saves succeed, they don't teleport. |
| 86–90 | One random creature in the region breaks spells for 1 hour. Whenever anyone within 20 feet of the creature casts a spell, the spellcaster must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using its spellcasting ability, or the spell drains away without effect. The spell slot, charge, or feature use that powered the spell is wasted. |
| 91–95 | During the next 24 hours, the first time a creature in the region targets another creature with a spell, the caster must make a DC 11 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, the spell targets the caster instead. On a successful save, the spell functions normally. This effect then ends. |
| 96–00 | One random creature in the region can suddenly cast the [wish](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/wish.md) spell once, within the next minute. Reroll if you've rolled this effect in the past 24 hours. |
