**Mirror Zone Effects**

| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 01–06 | Creatures in the region begin to display features other than their own for the next 24 hours. During that time, affected creatures have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks and ability checks made to disguise themselves. |
| 07–12 | The [hallucinatory terrain](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) spell (save DC 15) affects the natural terrain of the region, changing it into a different kind of terrain (DM's choice). |
| 13–18 | One random creature in the region gains the benefits of the [blink](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/blink.md) spell for 1 minute, shimmering with overlapping shattered reflections. |
| 19–24 | Creatures in the region don't cast reflections. Wisdom ([Insight](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks made against those creatures have disadvantage, and the creatures have disadvantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks made against anyone who notices their lack of [reflection](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/reflection-tce.md). When they leave the region, creatures regain their reflections, and the effect ends. |
| 25–34 | Reflections of `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) creatures in the region emerge from mirrors and attack. The [reflections](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/reflection-tce.md) are two-dimensional, shimmering versions of the creatures that cast them. Treat the reflections as [shadows](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) that are fey instead of undead and vulnerable to bludgeoning damage instead of radiant. |
| 35–40 | One character in the region gains the benefit of the [mirror image](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/mirror-image.md) spell. The images created sometimes move or speak of their own volition. |
| 41–46 | For the next 24 hours, certain wounds caused in the region attract spectral slivers of glass that cause extra damage. Any creature, other than a construct or an undead, hit by an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage begins to bleed, losing `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) hit points at the start of each of its turns. If the bleeding creature is hit by another such attack, the bleeding increases by `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check. The bleeding also stops if the target receives magical healing. |
| 47–52 | Mirrors and other highly reflective surfaces allow magical transport while in the region. Any creature that touches its [reflection](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/reflection-tce.md) in an object that it isn't wearing or carrying can immediately cast the [misty step](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/misty-step.md) spell, requiring no components. |
| 53–58 | One character can cast the [scrying](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell (save DC 17) once within the next 24 hours, requiring no components but using a mirror or other reflective surface. |
| 59–64 | The skin of one random creature in the region becomes silvery and reflective for the next 24 hours. For the duration, that creature has advantage on saving throws against spells, and spell attacks have disadvantage against that creature. |
| 65–70 | A longsword or shortsword with a blade made of a jagged mirror appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of a random creature in the region. The weapon is a [sword of wounding](4-Resources/Compendium/items/sword-of-wounding.md) (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). If the weapon's wielder rolls a 1 or 20 on an attack roll using the weapon, the weapon shatters and is destroyed after that attack. |
| 71–76 | For the next 24 hours, when anyone in the region hits a creature with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take force damage equal to half the damage dealt. |
| 77–82 | Two shimmering, vertical, reflective disks of energy appear in unoccupied spaces in the region for 1 minute. Each is 6 feet in diameter and floats 1 foot above the ground. One appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the party. Any creature that moves through the disk instantly appears within 5 feet of the other disk or the nearest unoccupied space. |
| 83–88 | The next time one character in the party sees their [reflection](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/reflection-tce.md) in the region, that [reflection](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/reflection-tce.md) of comes to life and engages its counterpart in conversation. It offers to answer one question posed to it as if the creature cast the [divination](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/divination.md) spell. After answering the question, the [reflection](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/fey/reflection-tce.md) returns to normal. |
| 89–94 | Floating shards of broken mirrors swirl through the region, showing reflections of creatures and places that aren't present, for the next minute before vanishing. On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), the shards make a ranged weapon attack (+6 to hit) against one random creature in the region. On a hit, the target takes 10 (`dice: 3d6\|avg` (`3d6`)) slashing damage. |
| 95–00 | A duplicate of one random creature in the region appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of that creature. The duplicate's appearance, game statistics, and equipment are identical to the creature's. The duplicate immediately attacks the creature, seeking to slay it. If the duplicate dies, it and all its equipment shatter into mirror shards. If the duplicate fails to slay the creature within 1 hour, the duplicate vanishes. |
