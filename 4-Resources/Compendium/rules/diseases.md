# Diseases

## Blinding Sickness
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded).

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Cackle Fever
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: "the shrieks."

Symptoms manifest `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of [exhaustion](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that can't be removed until the disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage and becomes [incapacitated](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the [incapacitated](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`). When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of [Madness](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/variant-rules/madness.md).

## Filth Fever
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

## Flesh Rot
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

## Mindfire
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [confusion](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/confusion.md) spell during combat.

## Seizure
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

## Sewer Plague
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of [exhaustion](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

On a successful save, the character's [exhaustion](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

## Sight Rot
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until its sight is restored by magic such as [lesser restoration](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) or [heal](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/heal.md).

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an [herbalism kit](4-Resources/Compendium/items/herbalism-kit.md) can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

## Slimy Doom
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [stunned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.
