*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 56*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level Warlock, Pact of the Blade

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a warlock spell slot to deal an extra `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) force damage to the target, plus another `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) per level of the spell slot, and you can knock the target [prone](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone) if it is Huge or smaller.
