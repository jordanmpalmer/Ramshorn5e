# Repulsion Shield
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 23*  

**Prerequisite**: 6th-level Artificer, A shield (requires attunement)

A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wielding this shield.

The shield has 4 charges. While holding it, the wielder can use a reaction immediately after being hit by a melee attack to expend 1 of the shield's charges and push the attacker up to 15 feet away. The shield regains `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn.
