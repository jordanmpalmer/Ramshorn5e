# Shadow Arrow
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 30*  

You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

The psychic damage increases to `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) when you reach 18th level in this class.
