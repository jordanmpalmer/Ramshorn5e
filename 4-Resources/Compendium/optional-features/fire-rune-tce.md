# Fire Rune
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 44*  

This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [restrained](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) for 1 minute. While [restrained](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the shackles, the target takes `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
