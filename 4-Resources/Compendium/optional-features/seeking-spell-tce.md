# Seeking Spell
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 66*  

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`), and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
