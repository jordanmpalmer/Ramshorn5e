# Armor of Magical Strength
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 20*  

**Prerequisite**: A suit of armor (requires attunement)

This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:

- When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.  
- If the creature would be knocked [prone](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone), it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.  

The armor regains `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) expended charges daily at dawn.
