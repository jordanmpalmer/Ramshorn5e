The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.
