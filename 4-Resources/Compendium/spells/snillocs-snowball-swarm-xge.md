# Snilloc's Snowball Swarm
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of ice or a small white rock chip
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/wizard.md)
