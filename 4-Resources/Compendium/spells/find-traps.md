# Find Traps
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the [alarm](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/alarm.md) spell, a [glyph of warding](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/glyph-of-warding.md), or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

**Classes**: [Cleric](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/cleric.md), [Druid](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/druid.md), [Ranger](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/ranger.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
