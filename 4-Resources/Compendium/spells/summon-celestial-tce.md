# Summon Celestial
*5th-level, Conjuration*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/img/summon-celestial.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a golden reliquary worth at least 500 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a celestial spirit. It manifests in an angelic form in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Celestial Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Avenger or Defender. Your choice determines the creature's attack in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its move to avoid danger.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
