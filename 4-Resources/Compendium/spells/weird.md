# Weird
*9th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes [frightened](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the [frightened](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 4d10|avg` (`4d10`) psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

**Classes**: [Wizard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/wizard.md)
