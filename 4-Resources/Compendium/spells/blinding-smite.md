# Blinding Smite
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra `dice: 3d8|avg` (`3d8`) radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the spell ends.

A creature [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded).

**Classes**: [Paladin](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/paladin.md)
