# Branding Smite
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's [invisible](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#invisible), and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become [invisible](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Artificer (Battle Smith)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/artificer-battle-smith-tce.md), [Paladin](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/paladin.md), [Warlock (The Hexblade)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/warlock-the-hexblade-xge.md)
