# Skill Empowerment
*5th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Your magic deepens a creature's understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.

You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.

**Classes**: [Artificer](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Bard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/bard.md), [Sorcerer](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/wizard.md)
