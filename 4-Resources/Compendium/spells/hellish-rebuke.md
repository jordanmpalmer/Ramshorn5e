# Hellish Rebuke
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S

You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes `dice: 2d10|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Paladin (Oathbreaker)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/paladin-oathbreaker.md), [Warlock](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/warlock.md)
