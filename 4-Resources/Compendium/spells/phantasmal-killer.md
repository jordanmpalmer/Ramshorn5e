# Phantasmal Killer
*4th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [frightened](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 4d10|avg` (`4d10`) psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Warlock (The Genie)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/warlock-the-genie-tce.md), [Warlock (The Hexblade)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/warlock-the-hexblade-xge.md), [Wizard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/wizard.md)
