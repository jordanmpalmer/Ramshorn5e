# Storm Sphere
*4th-level, Evocation*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/img/storm-sphere.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) lightning damage.

Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to listen.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage for each of its effects increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
