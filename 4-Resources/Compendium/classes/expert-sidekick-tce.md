## Class Features

### Sidekick Class (Level 1)

To gain the Expert class, a creature must have at least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

> [!note]
> this class is intended for NPC [sidekicks](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/variant-rules/sidekicks-tce.md).

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

*1st-level Expert feature*

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Dexterity, Intelligence, or Charisma.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in five skills of your choice, and it gains proficiency with light armor. If it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency with all simple weapons and with two tools of your choice.

### Helpful (Level 1)

*1st-level Expert feature*

The sidekick is adept at giving well-timed assistance; the sidekick can take the [Help](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Help) action as a bonus action.

### Cunning Action (Level 2)

*2nd-level Expert feature*

The sidekick's agility or quick thinking allows it to act speedily. On its turn in combat, it can take the [Dash](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Disengage), or [Hide](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action.

### Expertise (Level 3)

*3rd-level Expert feature*

Choose two of the sidekick's skill proficiencies. The sidekick's proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check it makes that uses any of the chosen proficiencies.

At 15th level, choose two more of the sidekick's skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

*4th-level Expert feature*

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Coordinated Strike (Level 6)

*6th-level Expert feature*

The sidekick is adept at fighting in concert with a companion. When the sidekick uses its Helpful feature to aid an ally in attacking a creature, that target can be up to 30 feet away from the sidekick, and the sidekick can deal an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) damage to it the next time the sidekick hits it with an attack roll before the end of the current turn. The extra damage is the same type of damage dealt by the attack.

### Evasion (Level 7)

*7th-level Expert feature*

Because of extraordinary good luck, the sidekick is skilled at avoiding danger. When the sidekick is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it failed. The sidekick doesn't benefit from this feature while [incapacitated](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 8)

*8th-level Expert feature*

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 10)

*10th-level Expert feature*

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Inspiring Help (Level 11)

*11th-level Expert feature*

When the sidekick takes the [Help](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Help) action, the creature who receives the help also gains a `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) bonus to the `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`) roll. If that roll is an attack roll, the creature can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the attack's damage roll against one target.

At 20th level, the bonus increases to `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`).

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 12)

*12th-level Expert feature*

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Reliable Talent (Level 14)

*14th-level Expert feature*

The sidekick has refined its skills to an exceptional degree. Whenever the sidekick makes an ability check that includes its whole proficiency bonus, it can treat a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`) roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Expertise (Level 15)
