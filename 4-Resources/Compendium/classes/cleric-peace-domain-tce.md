# Peace Domain
*[Cleric](cleric.md): Divine Domain*  
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 32*  


## Class Features

### Peace Domain (Level 1)

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

### Implement of Peace (Level 1)

*1st-level Peace Domain feature*

You gain proficiency in the [Insight](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Insight), [Performance](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Performance), or [Persuasion](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skill (your choice).

### Emboldening Bond (Level 1)

*1st-level Peace Domain feature*

You can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another. As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your proficiency bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a `dice: d4|avg` (`d4`) and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the `dice: d4|avg` (`d4`) no more than once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace (Level 2)

*2nd-level Peace Domain feature*

You can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

### Protective Bond (Level 6)

*6th-level Peace Domain feature*

The bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.

### Potent Spellcasting (Level 8)

*8th-level Peace Domain feature*

You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Blessed Strikes (Level 8)

*8th-level cleric [optional class features](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/variant-rules/optional-class-features-tce.md), which replaces the Potent Spellcasting feature*

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

### Expansive Bond (Level 17)

*17th-level Peace Domain feature*

The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else's damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.
