# Strong Wind
*Weather*  

A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom ([Perception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.
