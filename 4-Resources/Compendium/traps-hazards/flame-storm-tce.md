# Flame Storm
*Eldritch Storm*  

Sooty thunderclouds shot through with red and orange lightning release a deluge of fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning rain takes `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and ranged attack rolls.

A flame storm usually lasts `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) minutes, though the originating storm clouds can persist for days, creating multiple flame storms.
