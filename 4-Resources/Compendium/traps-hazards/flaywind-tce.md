# Flaywind
*Eldritch Storm*  

Supernaturally powerful winds—like those from planes such as Pandemonium or Minethys, the third layer of Carceri—can spawn flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.

A flaywind leaves `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) or ([Nature](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check or Wisdom ([Survival](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check allows a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind typically lasts `1d4 × 10` hours.
