# Heavy Precipitation
*Weather*  

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing.
