# Webs
*Generic Hazard*  

Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become [restrained](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the webs. A [restrained](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can use its action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.

Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.
