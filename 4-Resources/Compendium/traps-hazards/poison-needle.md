# Poison Needle
*Mechanical Trap*  

A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and `dice: 2d10|avg` (`2d10`) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle.

A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](4-Resources/Compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.
